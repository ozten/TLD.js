# TLD.js
**Update:** Closing signing for now, since we need to work through the two blocker issues, before this could move 
forward as a kickstarter or by other means of funding.

**Note:** This kick-starter hasn't been submitted yet. Please read and help solve open bugs.

``.io`` is an awesome general TLD for technical projects.  What if we had **.js for fantastic 
JavaScript** and NodeJS projects?  If you invest your time into sharing JavaScript, you should be 
able to easily share your work on an affordable .js domain.

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .js top level domain. An application is $180,000,
plus $5000 as a deposit, plus an unknown amount for application disputes and administrative fees.

We don't have $200,000 lying around, and need your help!

# Kickstarter Rewards

To motivate participation:

## $20

Skip coffee for a week and join the TLD.js movement!

You get ``jsfounder`` status. Register up to 4 domains in an exclusive 1 month window 
before general .js domain name availability.
 
Limited to first 10,000 pledges. No, seriously, remember how fast JSConf sells out ;)

## $500

Can you afford more? Passionate about the web and JS?

Same benefits as ``jsfounder`` as well as an invitation to join the governance committee.

Limited to first 50 pledges.

# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the web every day...  Shouldn't we have a TLD that 
JS hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... jquery.js to jquery, node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a *cheap*, **hawt name**? heavymetal.js or whatever is yours.

Domain squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the project's ability to limit or ban this behavior...

# After Kickstarter
Again, the governance committee would figure out how to make the TLD.js a substainable project that does not need frequent maintenance.

TLD.js is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough funds to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.js`` domains will be  as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a way to reward everyone who helped us 
secure this TLD.

# Who will run this?
[I](http://github.com/ozten) and the signers below, have offered to volunteer their time to organize this application process. If we successfully get the `.js` TLD, , we'll create a governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast.

An early suggestion would be getting under Mozilla.org's non-profit umbrella, but we can figure this out after a successful application.

/*
It is important that JS developers become responsible of .js,
Npm and github have been bought, autonomy is at risk
