# TLD.js
**Note:** This kick-starter hasn't been submitted yet. Please fork and improve, file issues against the idea, etc.

``.io`` was an awesome TLD for projects like [Socket.io](http://socket.io/). What if we had **.js for fantastic 
JavaScript** and Nodejs projects. You should have free or cheap domains for your Hacking pleasure.

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .js top level domain. An application is $180,000,
plus $5000 as a deposit, plus an unknown amount for applicaiton disputes, etc.

I've not done this before. I don't have $200,000 lying around. I need your help!

# Kickstarter Rewards
To motivate participation:

## $20
Skip coffee for a week and join the TLD.js movement!

Gets you ``webmaster4life`` status. Register up to 20 domains per year for free.
 
Limited to first 10,000 pledges. No, seriously, remember how fast JSConf sells out ;)

## $500
Can you afford more? Passionate about the web and JS?

Same benefits as ``webmaster4life`` as well as an invitation to join the governance committee.

Limited to first 50 pledges.

# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the web every day... shouldn't we have a TLD that 
we JS hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... jquery.js to jquery, node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a *cheap*, **hawt name**? heavymetal.js or whatever is yours.

Domain squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the projects ability to limit or ban this behavior...

# After Kickstarter
Again, the governance committee would figure out how to make care and feeding of TLD.js sustainable
and low maintence. This is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough funds
to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.js`` domains will be  as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a way to reward everyone who helped us 
secure this TLD.

# Who will run this?
[I](http://github.com/ozten) and the signers below, offer to volunteer our time to organize this applicaiton process. If we get it, we'll create a 
governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast.

An early suggestion would be getting under Mozilla.org's non-profit umbrella, but the we can 
figure this out after a successful application.
